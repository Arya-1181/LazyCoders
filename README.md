# LazyCoders

Full Stack Project README
This is a full stack web application project developed using Java, JSP, Servlet, HTML/CSS, and EJS. It provides a template for creating a robust web application with server-side rendering and dynamic content generation.

Features
Java: The backend of the application is built using Java, which provides a powerful and scalable foundation for handling server-side logic and data processing.

JSP (JavaServer Pages): JSP is used to generate dynamic content on the server side, allowing for easy integration of Java code within HTML templates.

Servlet: Servlets are used to handle HTTP requests and responses, enabling communication between the client and server.

HTML/CSS: The frontend of the application is built using HTML and CSS, providing the structure and styling for the user interface.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): EJS is a template engine that allows embedding JavaScript code within HTML templates, enabling dynamic content rendering on the client side.
